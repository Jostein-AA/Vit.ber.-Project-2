# Vit.ber.-Project-2
A project me and two others (Markus Trætli and Sindre Skaugset Olderkjær) wrote together for the subject "Vitenskapelige beregninger" at NTNU. The code is written in Python. I have excluded certain parts off our submission as they mostly contain mathematical derivations and solutions to math problems.
